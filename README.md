How to setup the Pixelmai overlay:
First, download the Violentmonkey extension.

URL: https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/

2. Once you have the extension installed, add the below script by going to the link and clicking the "install" button. 

URL: https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js

3. After you have installed the extension and the script, reload your reddit window if you have it open already, otherwise go to the main https://reddit.com/r/place page

4. You should see a config icon in the top corner (it looks like this https://i.imgur.com/xfPUhpI.png), click on it and it should open a popup in the middle of your screen.

If you cannot see it, try to reload the page again, sometimes that'll fix it

5. Add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YamaiSenpai/pixelmai/main/pixelmaioverlay.json to the "Template URL" field, and click "Always Load".

6. Lastly, reload your https://reddit.com/r/place page, and you should now see our overlay.

If you cant see it, try to reload the page again.
